# classifiers
Building classifiers with popular techniques (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

- in this repository I experiment with different classifiers using some data I scraped from Reddit, particularly the r/jobs subreddit.
    + scraped using PRAW


### What I've Learned:

- I learned more techniques for dealing with missing values, turning categorical variables into numerical values (one of the ways to do this is by using dummy variables)
- How to evaluate the accuracy of my classifier using a [Confusion Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix)
